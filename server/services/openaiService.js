  CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS - FOLLOW EXACTLY:
  1. Generate exactly 3 exercises (Beginner, Intermediate, Expert)
  2. Each exercise MUST contain exactly 10 questions - NO FEWER, NO MORE
  3. Total questions: 30 (10 per exercise)
  
  Exercise Structure:
  - BEGINNER exercise: exactly 10 questions about basic concepts
  - INTERMEDIATE exercise: exactly 10 questions about application  
  - EXPERT exercise: exactly 10 questions about complex analysis
  
  Each question MUST have:
  - Clear question text
  - Exactly 4 answer choices (A, B, C, D)
  - Only 1 correct answer
  - Detailed explanation
  
  IMPORTANT: If you generate fewer than 10 questions per exercise, the system will fail. You must generate exactly 10 questions for each of the 3 exercises.
