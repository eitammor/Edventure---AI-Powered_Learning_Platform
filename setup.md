# Setup Guide - AI Exercise Generator

This guide will help you set up and run the AI-powered exercise generator project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **OpenAI API key** (get one from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Clone and Navigate to Project
```bash
# If you're starting from scratch, create the project directory
mkdir exercise-generator
cd exercise-generator
```

### 2. Setup Backend (Server)

```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Create environment file
cp ../env.example .env

# Edit the .env file and add your OpenAI API key
# Replace 'your_openai_api_key_here' with your actual API key
```

**Important**: Edit the `.env` file in the server directory and replace `your_openai_api_key_here` with your actual OpenAI API key.

### 3. Setup Frontend (Client)

```bash
# Navigate to client directory
cd ../client

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### 4. Run the Application

You'll need to run both the backend and frontend simultaneously.

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
cd server
npm start
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

The application will be available at:
- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:5000

## Testing the Application

1. **Open your browser** and go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. **Enter a topic** (e.g., "JavaScript", "World History", "Machine Learning")
3. **Optionally add a subtopic** (e.g., "Promises", "Renaissance", "Neural Networks")
4. **Click "Generate Exercises"**
5. **Select a difficulty level** (Beginner, Intermediate, or Expert)
6. **Answer all 10 questions**
7. **Submit to see your results and explanations**
8. **Try the language toggle** to switch between English and Hebrew

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. CORS Errors**
- Make sure the backend is running on port 5000
- Check that the frontend proxy is set correctly in `client/package.json`

**2. OpenAI API Errors**
- Verify your API key is correct in the server `.env` file
- Check that you have credits in your OpenAI account
- Ensure the API key has the necessary permissions

**3. Port Already in Use**
- If port 5000 is busy, change the PORT in server `.env`
- If port 3000 is busy, React will automatically suggest an alternative

**4. Module Not Found Errors**
- Run `npm install` in both server and client directories
- Clear node_modules and reinstall if necessary

### Debug Mode

To enable detailed logging, add to your server `.env`:
```env
DEBUG=true
```
